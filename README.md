# About me
- Started working in 2014 with minecraft server plugins, [CardWars](https://github.com/FeldmannJR/CardWars) was my(not solo) first project, in this project learned basic OOP Java,SQL,   and networking, and a little bit of PHP.  
- Then proceded to work in 2015 InstaMC with multiple projects such as [InstaPokemon](https://github.com/FeldmannJR/InstaPokemon), leaving the project in 2017.  
- In 2018 started building a new minecraft server network from scratch([RedstoneGang](https://github.com/FeldmannJR/redstonegang)), due to several problems the project was never released.  
- And in 2020 started working at Compasso UOL developing ChatBots.
- I'm still working at Compasso, and in my freetime learning Rust at a slow pace.
